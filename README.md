Question:
Pick out one application area of Expert System and think out new area it can be applied .

Answer:
one of the application areas of Expert System that I chose to talk on is the "Agricultural Domain".

Already, we know that Expert System are computer application or program developed to solve complex problems in a particular or specific domain and that domain could be the medical domain, finance and commerce, agricultural domain, monitoring system, accounting, marketing, education and training etc.

Back to my own choice which is the Agricultural Domain:

Agriculture - expert systems can be used to optimize crop yields, protect against pests and diseases, and assist in farm management.
A new area that expert systems can be applied is in the field of agriculture. The expert system can be used to provide farmers with recommendations for crop management, including pest and disease control, irrigation schedules, and fertilization programs. The system can use data from sensors, weather stations, and other sources to provide customized recommendations for each field and crop type. This can help reduce waste, increase yields, and provide more sustainable and efficient agriculture practices.

What is a sensor?

A sensor is a device that detects and responds to a physical input, such as light, heat, pressure, motion, or chemical composition. 

Like I said that the system can use data from sensors like:

1. Soil moisture sensors: These measure the moisture content in the soil and help farmers determine the right time for irrigation.

2. Temperature sensors: These measure the temperature in the soil, air, or water and can help farmers optimize plant growth.

3. Light sensors: These measure the amount of light received by plants, helping farmers adjust lighting conditions for optimal growth.

4. Gas sensors: These detect the presence of harmful gases such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane in the environment and help farmers monitor the quality of air around the farm.

5. Weather sensors: These measure environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, providing farmers with critical data for crop management.


Thanks!
